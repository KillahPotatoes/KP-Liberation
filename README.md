## Overview
The area has fallen to the enemy, and it is up to you to take it back. Embark on a persistent campaign with your teammates to liberate all the major cities of the area that will most likely span several weeks of real time.
* Experience a massive “Capture the Island” campaign involving a large range of different settlements across the entire area.
* Cooperate with up to 34 players, including a Commanding role, two fire-team squads, a medevac and a logistical support squad as well as AI recruits to fill the gaps.
* Purchase both infantry and both ground and air vehicles using three different types of physical resources; supplies, ammunition and fuel.
* Build the FOB of your dreams with an in-game "what you see is what you get" system.
* Play within an immersive engine that not only punishes you for civilian casualty but diversely reacts in turn.
* Combat aggressive and cunning hostile forces who react and adapt to your actions.
* Monitor and work alongside, or against, independent guerrilla forces.
* Learn that every window is a threat thanks to the custom urban combat AI.
* Accomplish meaningful secondary objectives that will benefit your progression.
* Never lose your progress with the built-in server-side save system.
