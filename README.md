## ACE Serverside Settings
I've provided our community serverconfig.hpp for the [usage with the ace_server.pbo](https://ace3mod.com/wiki/framework/settings-framework.html#32-loading-up-the-server-config) for dedicated servers.
Just copy the userconfig folder into your ArmA 3 Server folder and start the ace_server.pbo as serverside mod.

## Recommended Difficulty Settings
I recommend to use the following difficulty settings for this mission (User profile of your server):
```
class CustomDifficulty
{
	class Options
	{
		groupIndicators=0;
		friendlyTags=0;
		enemyTags=0;
		detectedMines=0;
		commands=0;
		waypoints=0;
		weaponInfo=1;
		stanceIndicator=1;
		reducedDamage=0;
		staminaBar=0;
		weaponCrosshair=0;
		visionAid=0;
		thirdPersonView=0;
		cameraShake=1;
		scoreTable=0;
		deathMessages=0;
		vonID=1;
		mapContent=0;
		autoReport=0;
		multipleSaves=0;
		squadRadar=0;
		tacticalPing=0;
	};
	aiLevelPreset=1;
};
```

In the server config file:
```
forcedDifficulty = "custom";

class Missions
{
	class kp_liberation
	{
		template = "kp_liberation.Altis";
		difficulty = "custom";
	};
};
```
