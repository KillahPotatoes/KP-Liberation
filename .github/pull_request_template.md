<!--
As soon as you've tested your feature on the listed environment you can check the checkbox.
It has to work without any issues and errors in your own tests.
Especially if you open a PR as WIP and not after you've fully finished your work, remember to update the states accordingly.
-->

### Compatibility checked with:
* ACE
* Mod XYZ

<!--
Add a list of Mods you've checked. This should only contain mods which really affect the feature.
So for a feature like e.g. "hint on entering a sector area" you don't list/test compatibility with RHS, ACE, Achilles, etc.
Also listing CBA isn't necessary, as it's a general dependency in Liberation.
